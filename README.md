### Description:
Using python, we combined openCV, numpy and tkinter to make a real life face filter app on your pc.
Our core feature is face detection. Our app can detect your face in real time, and add some fun features such as beard, hat, emoji and change the filter, all at instant. 
We can detect multiple faces, change in between filters and add different filters together.
